                It has been an absolute pleasure working with Kristian. His expert ability to understand and identify business needs, analyse data across multiple areas, and provide the executive team with the insights required for strategic decision-making is outstanding.
                Kristian’s ability to collaborate across all levels of the organisation, present complex ideas clearly to executive team members, and proactively drive initiatives makes him a truly invaluable asset.
                He doesn’t just respond to business needs—he anticipates them, delivering innovative solutions that leaders didn’t even know they needed.
                His deep understanding of technology and platforms, coupled with his continuous research into the latest advancements, has significantly benefited the business. 
                Kristian’s contributions have not only driven efficiency and innovation but have also been recognised at a group level, with multiple awards for his pioneering work in AI and other transformative initiatives. 
                His impact on my teams and the wider organisation has been immense, and I have no doubt that he will continue to excel in any endeavour he takes on.

                I worked with Kristian while at ON Semiconductor. He lead a team that provided first-level support for our Camstar MES manufacturing sites globally, and he was the 2018 PwC audit point-of-contact for ATO CIM. 
                I partnered very closely with him in both roles. He is an excellent communicator with great analytical and problem solving skills. 
                He has always been someone that I could trust and depend on. And he was a consistent encouragement and example to all of those around him. 
                His leadership, his support, and all of the other qualities highlighted above are already missed, but will surely be credited to his next role and employer.

                Kristian started as a cadet engineer at ON Semiconductor Phils Inc. 
                After the 8 months training, he has shown exemplary performance, presented technical papers, performed above and beyond, led teams of engineers and has made his way up as a section manager. 
                His inquisitiveness led to so much learning and he never rests on his laurels. His passion to learn never ceases. I am sure this young, passionate and dedicated engineer will be a CIO someday.

                Kristian is a great professional and I am glad that we worked together in HCM Implementation. 
                He was leading the entire HCM track from the business. His extensive system knowledge combined with HR process knowledge and his ability to adapt the global best practices helped in finalizing a robust HCM Solution. 
                It was such a pleasure to work with an intelligent person like Kristian and am sure he is a C-Level executive in the making.

                Kristian was a Subject Matter Expert during his teaching stint in De La Salle University - Dasmarinas. I was his student in a semiconductor fundamentals class for the microelectronics track of our ECE program. 
                I can attest to his effective communication style and robust knowledge of the subject he's teaching as he was able to relay complicated theories into practical bites digestible to audiences of various intellectual capacities. 
                Further, what made classes interesting were his sharing of experiences that bridged the wide gap of theory and practice in the semiconductor industry. 
                He was able to handle young, inexperienced, and assuming college students because he exemplified servant leadership and good character. 
                He was generous with his knowledge and time and understands that cascading it not only benefits him, but also future professionals. 
                His successful transition from the semiconductor industry to information technology speaks volumes not only to his intellectual ability, but also to his grit, tenacity, and growth mindset. 
                It will not come as a surprise if he becomes successful at anything he does.

                Kristian is a very detailed, organized, meticulous person and knows exactly how his system should work. 
                When your client has that level of clarity and vision, your job becomes very easy as a consultant. 
                Kristian has provided invaluable support throughout the implementation program.
